 * Model-based conformance test for libevpl's core SDK.
 *
 * The RPC2 conformance tests replay a table of independent cases.  This one
 * replays PROGRAMS: quint/core.qnt models the core API as a state machine,
 * and each generated program is a sequence of SDK calls against a freshly
 * created evpl.  This file is the interpreter.
 *
 * The oracle is not a return value -- an asynchronous API has none to check
 * against.  It is the event log.  Each program op registers, arms or retires
 * something; each OpQuiesce runs the loop to an absolute deadline and then
 * holds the callbacks that arrived against the obligations the model says
 * were owed, in three directions:
 *
 *   - every obligation is discharged (a missing callback is a caller waiting
 *     forever, which in production is a hang and not a crash);
 *   - no callback arrives that nothing expected (this is what makes "the
 *     removed timer stopped firing" and "the one-shot did not refire"
 *     observable at all -- they are absences);
 *   - callbacks that the model orders arrive in that order.
 *
 * A quiesce therefore always runs its whole window and never returns early on
 * satisfaction: an early exit would observe no absence, and the second and
 * third checks above would be worthless.
 *
 * Backend adapters select concrete protocols and storage devices. Generated
 * traces describe stream/message/datagram contracts and carry exact lengths;
 * no adapter changes their operations or expected callback obligations.
 *
 * The model encodes the SPECIFICATION that include/evpl states, so a mismatch
 * is a candidate bug in libevpl rather than a broken test.  Reviewed,
 * consciously deferred divergences go in known_divergences[] with a note;
 * anything else fails.

 * How long to keep driving the loop at the end of a window for obligations
 * that have not arrived yet.
 *
 * evpl_listener_create() runs the accept path on a thread of its own, and the
 * block backends run their I/O on one, so those arrivals are handed across
 * threads and how long they take is a property of the scheduler and the
 * storage rather than of libevpl.  Waiting for them costs nothing when they
 * are prompt and does not weaken anything: a callback that must arrive is
 * waited for, while a callback that must NOT arrive is still decided by the
 * clock, which does not move here.
 *
 * The bound is real time, not a pass count.  It used to be 200000 passes of a
 * non-blocking poll, on the reasoning that exhausting it "takes well under a
 * second" -- true only while this loop is not competing for a core with the
 * thread it is waiting on.  On a four-vCPU CI runner with several of these
 * tests in flight it competes hard, and the pread backend's device thread is
 * doing real pread/pwrite and, for a flush or a synced write, fsync against a
 * file on a container filesystem.  A single fsync there can outlast the whole
 * spin, and the result was a completion reported missing in the window that
 * owed it and extra in a window nine steps later -- the callback was late,
 * never lost.
 *
 * Time is the honest unit for that, because what is being waited on is
 * another thread finishing real work.  It does not touch the modelled
 * deadlines, which remain the virtual clock's; it only decides how long to
 * wait before calling a missing callback missing.
 *
 * AWAIT_SPIN_PASSES keeps the fast path hot -- a prompt callback is picked up
 * without ever sleeping -- and the sleep after it stops this loop from
 * starving the very thread it is waiting for.
 *
 * The limit stays modest on purpose.  It is a backstop against a genuine
 * hang, and every step that is really broken now costs it, so a limit
 * generous enough to hide a slow disk must still leave a broken run able to
 * report inside ctest's timeout.
